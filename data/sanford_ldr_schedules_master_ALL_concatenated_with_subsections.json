These design guidelines are intended as a reference to assist the designer in understanding the city's goals and objectives for high quality, multiple-family residential development. Multifamily housing, because of its higher densities, tends to generate large parking areas and decreases private open space. If not properly designed, parking facilities can dominate the site and open spaces may be relegated to leftover areas, not related to the structures or the people who live there. The result of such a condition may be that the development is incompatible with existing and planned developments in the surrounding area. However, if special attention is paid to site and building design features, even large multifamily projects can be made compatible with the City’s overall character and appearance. In the design of multifamily developments, emphasis should be placed on giving each unit or each small cluster of units a sense of individual identity rather than an B. Applicability.

Applicability. In accordance with the most recent edition of the City's Reclaimed Water and Code, all new developments shall utilize the City's reclaimed water system for irrigation and other uses that do not require potable water. Reclaimed water facilities shall be independent of all potable water, raw water supply, wastewater, and storm water systems. Materials used in the installation and construction of reclaimed water systems shall be the same as that used for potable water facilities, with the exception of the color-coding, and shall be as specifically described in the City’s Utilities Manual. B. Evaluation. For all new developments, the Utilities Director shall evaluate the need of the development to incorporate the use of reclaimed water. The Director shall review the takeback capacity of the proposed development to determine if connection to the reclaimed water system represents a benefit to the City. The developer’s engineer shall place all take-back calculations, based on City approved wastewater flow quantities, on the development plans. Reclaimed water usage shall equal or exceed anticipated wastewater flows. If a required irrigation system will have a negative impact on environmental systems or is inconsistent with the rules of other regulatory jurisdictions, the Utilities Director may approve an alternative irrigation system. C. Mandatory Connection. Upon completion of the evaluation, the Utilities Director shall have the authority to require the development, including all individual l lots and tracts therein, to connect to the reclaimed water system.
